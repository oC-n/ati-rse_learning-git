# Hypothesis: Stories Are Driven By Decisions and Consequences

Critical to narrative seems to be characters' need to make decisions that have consequences. The more important the decision, the greater the consequence, the more engaging the story might be. Certainly I suspect such decision & consequence makes for greater momentum when writing. A story is often described as telling of a change of state and how it comes about for a character.

So a challenge I'm giving myself now is a kind of game called "what's the consequence?" In this, an action or decision is specified, and the aim is to imagine a consequence - ideally, as many consequences as possible, including the implausible!  For example:
- Cause: I decided to call in sick and skip work today.
- Cause: I stayed for one more drink.
