Connections Game
================

Another critical element of stories is the connections between characters. Indeed, one role of stories is to connect us who read them.

The Challenge
-------------
Take two characters from two different stories, and list:
* One commonality they share: on what ground could they feel they belong to the same community?
* 5 imagined events that could connect them to each other.
* 1 event from each of their respective stories that could connect them.
